In src there is a boilerplate implementaiton of an event based architecture

The events written are not representative of the apps context. The boilerplate has payments context but this will be a blog's backend server, to post and serve original content.


All events: 
About posts we want to:
- (admin)create a post:
- (public)get posts delta // will get posts newer than the last sync date
- (admin)update a post
- (public)get a post 
- (public)subscribe to news-leter
- (public)get all posts
- (public)get posts with filter

About the admin we simply want to 
- (public)connect // event that accepts email and password and returns a token

Collections will be: 
- posts
- admin // collection with a single doc that will have the admin user data (email and password)
- emails // collection with users email data
- socials // collection with single doc that will have the socials data
- subscriptions // collection with users subscriptions data
